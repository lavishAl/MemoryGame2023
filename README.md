## Game Description - Save Gotham
"In this memory card game, you take on the role of Batman, the Dark Knight, and your mission is to save Gotham City from its notorious villains. The city is infested with criminals who must be captured and brought to justice. To achieve this, you must find matching pairs of cards that represent these villains.

The game board consists of a grid of cards, each hiding the image of a villain. Your task is to flip over two cards at a time, trying to find a matching pair. If you successfully match a pair, the cards remain face up, representing the captured villains. However, if the two cards do not match, they will be flipped back over, and you must try again.

Beware, time is of the essence! You have a limited number of moves to capture all the villains before they escape and Gotham City falls into chaos. Keep an eye on the number of moves remaining and strategize your choices wisely.
